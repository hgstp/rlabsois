<h2>Hot Hands</h2>
<p>Basketball players who make several baskets in succession are described as having a <em>hot hand</em>. Fans and players have long believed in the hot hand phenomenon, which refutes the assumption that each shot is independent of the next. However, a 1985 paper by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky collected evidence that contradicted this belief and showed that successive shots are independent events (<a href="http://psych.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/Gilo.Vallone.Tversky.pdf" class="uri">http://psych.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/Gilo.Vallone.Tversky.pdf</a>). This paper started a great controversy that continues to this day, as you can see by Googling <em>hot hand basketball</em>.</p>
<p>We do not expect to resolve this controversy today. However, in this lab we’ll apply one approach to answering questions like this. The goals for this lab are to (1) think about the effects of independent and dependent events, (2) learn how to simulate shooting streaks in R, and (3) to compare a simulation to actual data in order to determine if the hot hand phenomenon appears to be real.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-getting-started" class="section level2">
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Our investigation will focus on the performance of one player: Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers. His performance against the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA finals earned him the title <em>Most Valuable Player</em> and many spectators commented on how he appeared to show a hot hand. Let’s load some data from those games and look at the first several rows.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>download.file(&quot;http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/kobe.RData&quot;, destfile = &quot;kobe.RData&quot;)

  </script>
</div>
<p>In this data frame, every row records a shot taken by Kobe Bryant. If he hit the shot (made a basket), a hit, <code>H</code>, is recorded in the column named <code>basket</code>, otherwise a miss, <code>M</code>, is recorded.</p>
<p>Just looking at the string of hits and misses, it can be difficult to gauge whether or not it seems like Kobe was shooting with a hot hand. One way we can approach this is by considering the belief that hot hand shooters tend to go on shooting streaks. For this lab, we define the length of a shooting streak to be the <em>number of consecutive baskets made until a miss occurs</em>.</p>
<p>For example, in Game 1 Kobe had the following sequence of hits and misses from his nine shot attempts in the first quarter:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \textrm{H M | M | H H M | M | M | M} \]</span></p>
<p>To verify this use the following command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kobe$basket[1:9]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;H&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;M&quot; &quot;M&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Within the nine shot attempts, there are six streaks, which are separated by a “|” above. Their lengths are one, zero, two, zero, zero, zero (in order of occurrence).</p>
<p>The custom function</p>
<pre class="r"><code>calc_streak</code></pre>
<pre><code>## function(x){
##   y &lt;- rep(0,length(x))
##   y[x == &quot;H&quot;] &lt;- 1
##   y &lt;- c(0, y, 0)
##   wz &lt;- which(y == 0)
##   streak &lt;- diff(wz) - 1
##   return(streak)
## }</code></pre>
<p>which was loaded in with the data, may be used to calculate the lengths of all shooting streaks and then look at the distribution.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>kobe_streak &lt;- calc_streak(kobe$basket)
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(data.frame(kobe_streak = kobe_streak), aes(x = kobe_streak)) + geom_bar()</code></pre>
<p><img src="probability_files/figure-html/calc-streak-kobe-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>Note that instead of making a histogram, we chose to make a bar plot of the streak data. A bar plot is preferable here since our variable is discrete – counts – instead of continuous.</p>
<div id="section-exercise" class="section level4">
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>Describe the distribution of Kobe’s streak lengths from the 2009 NBA finals. What was his typical streak length? How long was his longest streak of baskets?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-compared-to-what" class="section level2">
<h2>Compared to What?</h2>
<p>We’ve shown that Kobe had some long shooting streaks, but are they long enough to support the belief that he had hot hands? What can we compare them to?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, let’s return to the idea of <em>independence</em>. Two processes are independent if the outcome of one process doesn’t effect the outcome of the second. If each shot that a player takes is an independent process, having made or missed your first shot will not affect the probability that you will make or miss your second shot.</p>
<p>A shooter with a hot hand will have shots that are <em>not</em> independent of one another. Specifically, if the shooter makes his first shot, the hot hand model says he will have a <em>higher</em> probability of making his second shot.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose for a moment that the hot hand model is valid for Kobe. During his career, the percentage of time Kobe makes a basket (i.e. his shooting percentage) is about 45%, or in probability notation,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.45 \]</span></p>
<p>If he makes the first shot and has a hot hand (<em>not</em> independent shots), then the probability that he makes his second shot would go up to, let’s say, 60%,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(\textrm{shot 2 = H} \, | \, \textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.60 \]</span></p>
<p>As a result of these increased probabilites, you’d expect Kobe to have longer streaks. Compare this to the skeptical perspective where Kobe does <em>not</em> have a hot hand, where each shot is independent of the next. If he hit his first shot, the probability that he makes the second is still 0.45.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ P(\textrm{shot 2 = H} \, | \, \textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.45 \]</span></p>
<p>In other words, making the first shot did nothing to effect the probability that he’d make his second shot. If Kobe’s shots are independent, then he’d have the same probability of hitting every shot regardless of his past shots: 45%.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve phrased the situation in terms of independent shots, let’s return to the question: how do we tell if Kobe’s shooting streaks are long enough to indicate that he has hot hands? We can compare his streak lengths to someone without hot hands: an independent shooter.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-simulations-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Simulations in R</h2>
<p>While we don’t have any data from a shooter we know to have independent shots, that sort of data is very easy to simulate in R. In a simulation, you set the ground rules of a random process and then the computer uses random numbers to generate an outcome that adheres to those rules. As a simple example, you can simulate flipping a fair coin with the following.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>outcomes &lt;- c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;)
sample(outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;heads&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The vector <code>outcomes</code> can be thought of as a hat with two slips of paper in it: one slip says <code>heads</code> and the other says <code>tails</code>. The function <code>sample</code> draws one slip from the hat and tells us if it was a head or a tail.</p>
<p>Run the second command listed above several times. Just like when flipping a coin, sometimes you’ll get a heads, sometimes you’ll get a tails, but in the long run, you’d expect to get roughly equal numbers of each.</p>
<div id="section-exercise-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>Simulate flipping a fair coin 100 times. Use <code>table()</code> to show the distribution of heads and tails in this sample of size 100.</p>
<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="sim-fair-coin-setup" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">

table(sim_fair_coin)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Since there are only two elements in <code>outcomes</code>, the probability that we “flip” a coin and it lands heads is 0.5.</p>
<p>In the next exercise we want to simulate an unfair coin. Try to figure out how to do this by looking at the help file of <code>sample</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-exercise-2" class="section level4">

<p>Simulate flipping an unfair coin 100 times, that only lands heads 20% of the time. Use again <code>table()</code> to show the distribution of heads and tails in this sample of size 100.</p>

<pre class="text"><code>sim_unfair_coin &lt;- sample(outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.8))

#we want to select the first one, `heads`, with probability 0.2 and the second 
#one, `tails` with probability 0.8
table(sim_unfair_coin)</code></pre>
</div>
<p>In a sense, we’ve shrunken the size of the slip of paper that says “heads”, making it less likely to be drawn and we’ve increased the size of the slip of paper saying “tails”, making it more likely to be drawn. When we simulated the fair coin, both slips of paper were the same size. This happens by default if you don’t provide a <code>prob</code> argument; all elements in the <code>outcomes</code> vector have an equal probability of being drawn.</p>

<h2>Simulating the Independent Shooter</h2>
<p>Simulating a basketball player who has independent shots uses the same mechanism that we use to simulate a coin flip. To simulate a single shot from an independent shooter with a shooting percentage of 50% we type,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>outcomes &lt;- c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;M&quot;)
sim_basket &lt;- sample(outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>To make a valid comparison between Kobe and our simulated independent shooter, we need to align both their shooting percentage and the number of attempted shots.</p>

<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>What change needs to be made to the <code>sample()</code> function so that it reflects a shooting percentage of 45%? Make this adjustment, then run a simulation to sample 133 shots. Assign the output of this simulation to a new object called <code>sim_basket</code>.</p>
