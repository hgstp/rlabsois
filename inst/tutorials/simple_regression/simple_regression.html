<h2>Batter up</h2>
<p>The movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)">Moneyball</a> focuses on the “quest for the secret of success in baseball”. It follows a low-budget team, the Oakland Athletics, who believed that underused statistics, such as a player’s ability to get on base, betterpredict the ability to score runs than typical statistics like home runs, RBIs (runs batted in), and batting average. Obtaining players who excelled in these underused statistics turned out to be much more affordable for the team.</p>
<p>In this lab we’ll be looking at data from all 30 Major League Baseball teams and examining the linear relationship between runs scored in a season and a number of other player statistics. Our aim will be to summarize these relationships both graphically and numerically in order to find which variable, if any, helps us best predict a team’s runs scored in a season.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>The data</h2>
<p>Let’s load up the data for the 2011 season.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>download.file(&quot;http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/mlb11.RData&quot;, destfile = &quot;mlb11.RData&quot;)
load(&quot;mlb11.RData&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In addition to runs scored, there are seven traditionally used variables in the data set: at-bats, hits, home runs, batting average, strikeouts, stolen bases, and wins. There are also three newer variables: on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and on-base plus slugging. For the first portion of the analysis we’ll consider the seven traditional variables. At the end of the lab, you’ll work with the newer variables on your own.</p>
<div id="section-exercise" class="section level4">
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>What type of plot would you use to display the relationship between <code>runs</code> and one of the other numerical variables? Plot this relationship using the variable <code>at_bats</code> as the predictor. Does the relationship look linear? If you knew a team’s <code>at_bats</code>, would you be comfortable using a linear model to predict the number of runs?</p>

</div>
<p>If the relationship looks linear, we can quantify the strength of the relationship with the correlation coefficient.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cor(mlb11$runs, mlb11$at_bats)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.610627</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-sum-of-squared-residuals" class="section level2">
<h2>Sum of squared residuals</h2>
<p>Think back to the way that we described the distribution of a single variable. Recall that we discussed characteristics such as center, spread, and shape. It’s also useful to be able to describe the relationship of two numerical variables, such as <code>runs</code> and <code>at_bats</code> above.</p>
<div id="section-exercise-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>Looking at your plot from the previous exercise, describe the relationship between these two variables. Make sure to discuss the form, direction, and strength of the relationship as well as any unusual observations.</p>
<p>Just as we used the mean and standard deviation to summarize a single variable, we can summarize the relationship between these two variables by finding the line that best follows their association. Use the following interactive function to select the line that you think does the best job of going through the cloud of points.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_ss(x = mlb11$at_bats, y = mlb11$runs)</code></pre>
<p><img src="simple_regression_files/figure-html/plotss-atbats-runs-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<pre><code>## Click two points to make a line.
                                
## Call:
## lm(formula = y ~ x, data = pts)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)            x  
##  -2789.2429       0.6305  
## 
## Sum of Squares:  123721.9</code></pre>
<p>After downloading the data in a separate RStudio session, you will also the the function <code>plot_ss()</code> in your working environment. Please run the above command in such a separate RStudio sesssion. After running this command, you’ll be prompted to click two points on the plot to define a line. Once you’ve done that, the line you specified will be shown in black and the residuals in blue. Note that there are 30 residuals, one for each of the 30 observations. Recall that the residuals are the difference between the observed values and the values predicted by the line:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i
\]</span></p>
<p>The most common way to do linear regression is to select the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals. To visualize the squared residuals, you can rerun the plot command and add the argument <code>showSquares = TRUE</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_ss(x = mlb11$at_bats, y = mlb11$runs, showSquares = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p><img src="simple_regression_files/figure-html/plotss-atbats-runs-squares-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<pre><code>## Click two points to make a line.

##  -2789.2429       0.6305  
## 
## Sum of Squares:  123721.9</code></pre>
<p>Note that the output from the <code>plot_ss</code> function provides you with the slope and intercept of your line as well as the sum of squares.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-exercise-2" class="section level4">
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>Using <code>plot_ss</code>, choose a line that does a good job of minimizing the sum of squares. Run the function several times. What was the smallest sum of squares that you got? How does it compare to your neighbors?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-the-linear-model" class="section level2">
<h2>The linear model</h2>
<p>It is rather cumbersome to try to get the correct least squares line, i.e. the line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals, through trial and error. Instead we can use the <code>lm</code> function in R to fit the linear model (a.k.a. regression line).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>m1 &lt;- lm(runs ~ at_bats, data = mlb11)</code></pre>
<p>The first argument in the function <code>lm</code> is a formula that takes the form <code>y ~ x</code>. Here it can be read that we want to make a linear model of <code>runs</code> as a function of <code>at_bats</code>. The second argument specifies that R should look in the <code>mlb11</code> data frame to find the <code>runs</code> and <code>at_bats</code> variables.</p>
<p>The output of <code>lm</code> is an object that contains all of the information we need about the linear model that was just fit. We can access this information using the summary function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(m1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = runs ~ at_bats, data = mlb11)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -125.58  -47.05  -16.59   54.40  176.87 
##

## (Intercept) -2789.2429   853.6957  -3.267 0.002871 ** 
## at_bats         0.6305     0.1545   4.080 0.000339 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 66.47 on 28 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.3729, Adjusted R-squared:  0.3505 
## F-statistic: 16.65 on 1 and 28 DF,  p-value: 0.0003388</code></pre>
<p>Let’s consider this output piece by piece. First, the formula used to describe the model is shown at the top. After the formula you find the five-number summary of the residuals. The “Coefficients” table shown next is key; its first column displays the linear model’s y-intercept and the coefficient of <code>at_bats</code>. With this table, we can write down the least squares regression line for the linear model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \widehat{y} = -2789.2429 + 0.6305 \cdot  \text{at\_bats}
\]</span></p>
<p>One last piece of information we will discuss from the summary output is the Multiple R-squared, or more simply, <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> value represents the proportion of variability in the response variable that is explained by the explanatory variable. For this model, 37.3% of the variability in runs is explained by at-bats.</p>
<div id="section-exercise-3" class="section level4">
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>Fit a new model that uses <code>homeruns</code> to predict <code>runs</code>. Using the estimates from the R output, write the equation of the regression line. What does the slope tell us in the context of the relationship between success of a team and its home runs?</p>

<div class="tutorial-exercise-support" data-label="lm-homeruns-solution" data-caption="Code" data-completion="0" data-diagnostics="1" data-startover="1" data-lines="0">
<pre class="text"><code>mod_hr &lt;- lm(runs ~ homeruns, data = mlb11)

summary(mod_hr)
# fitted value = 415.239 + 1.835 * homeruns
#
# the model predicts that on average a team scores twice for each additional homerun</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-prediction-and-prediction-errors" class="section level2">
<h2>Prediction and prediction errors</h2>
<p>Let’s create a scatterplot with the least squares line laid on top.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(mlb11, aes(at_bats, runs)) + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = &quot;lm&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="simple_regression_files/figure-html/reg-with-line-1.png" width="624" /></p>
<p>The function <code>geom_smooth()</code> plots a line based on the slope and intercept, which are determined by <code>lm()</code>. This is due to the fact that we choose the smoothing method equal to <code>lm</code>. This line can be used to predict <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> at any value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. When predictions are made for values of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that are beyond the range of the observed data, it is referred to as <em>extrapolation</em> and is not usually recommended. However, predictions made within the range of the data are more reliable. They’re also used to compute the residuals.</p>
<div id="section-exercise-4" class="section level4">
<h4>Exercise</h4>
<p>If a team manager saw the least squares regression line and not the actual data, how many runs would he or she predict for a team with 5,579 at-bats? Is this an overestimate or an underestimate, and by how much? In other words, what is the residual for this prediction?</p>

<h2>On Your Own</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Choose another traditional variable from <code>mlb11</code> that you think might be a good predictor of <code>runs</code>. Produce a scatterplot of the two variables and fit a linear model. At a glance, does there seem to be a linear relationship?</p></li>
<li><p>How does this relationship compare to the relationship between <code>runs</code> and <code>at_bats</code>? Use the R<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span> values from the two model summaries to compare. Does your variable seem to predict <code>runs</code> better than <code>at_bats</code>? How can you tell?</p></li>
<li><p>Now that you can summarize the linear relationship between two variables, investigate the relationships between <code>runs</code> and each of the other five traditional variables. Which variable best predicts <code>runs</code>? Support your conclusion using the graphical and numerical methods we’ve discussed (for the sake of conciseness, only include output for the best variable, not all five).</p></li>
<li><p>Now examine the three newer variables. These are the statistics used by the author of <em>Moneyball</em> to predict a teams success. In general, are they more or less effective at predicting runs that the old variables? Explain using appropriate graphical and numerical evidence. Of all ten variables we’ve analyzed, which seems to be the best predictor of <code>runs</code>? Using the limited (or not so limited) information you know about these baseball statistics, does your result make sense?</p></li>
